Exercise 1 Workshop In Communication Networks - Benchmarking Throughput
Authors: Yosef Edery and Leon Gershko

The goal of the implemented code was to measure point-to-point (unidirectional) throughput between two machines,
for an exponential series of message sizes, ranging from 1 byte to 1MB.
The implemented code had a server and a client component, both written in C++, that shared some code.
The server had to be run first and the client second. The client connected to the server and sent a
certain number of messages. After all messages had arrived, the server replied and the client calculated the
throughput based on the time it all took.

The performance results obtained from running the implemented code were as follows:

Message Size (Bytes) | Throughput (Bytes/s)
1 | 1.11508e+06
2 | 1.95676e+06
4 | 4.46578e+06
8 | 8.12678e+06
16 | 1.55415e+07
32 | 2.66378e+07
64 | 4.5329e+07
128 | 1.30386e+08
256 | 2.36796e+08
512 | 3.76249e+08
1024 | 6.42974e+08

As can be seen from the results, the throughput increased as the message size increased, which is expected since
larger messages can be transmitted more efficiently due to the overhead of setting up a network connection.
The results show that the implemented code was successful in measuring the point-to-point throughput for an
exponential series of message sizes.
