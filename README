Exercise 1 Workshop In Communication Networks - Benchmarking Throughput
Authors: Yosef Edery and Leon Gershko

To use on linux, open terminal and run following lines:
>> make
>> server
>> client 127.0.0.1

The goal of the implemented code was to measure point-to-point (unidirectional) throughput between two machines,
for an exponential series of message sizes, ranging from 1 byte to 1MB.
The implemented code had a server and a client component, both written in C++, that shared some code.
The server had to be run first and the client second. The client connected to the server and sent a
certain number of messages. After all messages had arrived, the server replied and the client calculated the
throughput based on the time it all took.
