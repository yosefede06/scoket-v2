Exercise 1 Workshop In Communication Networks - Benchmarking Throughput
Authors: Yosef Edery and Leon Gershko

To use on linux
Open terminal and run following lines:
make
server
client 127.0.0.1

The goal of the implemented code was to measure point-to-point (unidirectional) throughput between two machines,
for an exponential series of message sizes, ranging from 1 byte to 1MB.
The implemented code had a server and a client component, both written in C++, that shared some code.
The server had to be run first and the client second. The client connected to the server and sent a
certain number of messages. After all messages had arrived, the server replied and the client calculated the
throughput based on the time it all took.

The performance results obtained from running the implemented code were as follows:

Message Size (Bytes) | Throughput (Bytes/s)
1       0.20962 bytes/microseconds
2       0.42007 bytes/microseconds
4       0.82763 bytes/microseconds
8       1.66698 bytes/microseconds
16      3.32564 bytes/microseconds
32      6.67501 bytes/microseconds
64      13.342  bytes/microseconds
128     26.7771 bytes/microseconds
256     53.4838 bytes/microseconds
512     104.317 bytes/microseconds
1024    209.604 bytes/microseconds

As can be seen from the results, the throughput increased as the message size increased, which is expected since
larger messages can be transmitted more efficiently.
The results show that the implemented code was successful in measuring the point-to-point throughput for an
exponential series of message sizes.
